I developed the intial game demo and added enemies. Currently working on creating a template in scripts that allows us to produce levels easily by giving access to "difficulty" values and keeping core data that persist through levels or scences -Justin

Created menu for the game and am currently working on a new scene to call inbetween levels to transition them - Devante

I have been working on developing new graphics for the game in Blender and Magica Voxel(mostly Blender) and am currently working on some issues partaining to the inegration of said graphics - Juan

I have wrote all the core game scripts and and created many of the core game aspects such as enemies, hazards, lighting ext.. Currently working on producing more in depth levels while also using Josh's hazard spawn designs. -Justin

Created visual aspects of the menu and all scripts involved with menu management. Designed fade transitions inbetween scenes as well as wrote the script for it. Currenly working on addtional transitional scenes to place inbetween each level. -Devante

I have made numerous object and graphic files for the game, some including the player ship and the bolt model that shoots when the player fires. I am currently working on different astroid, player and weapon models. -Juan

Devloped menu and level music for the game as well as wrote numerous pattern based spawning methods for the hazards in the game to create a more "bullet hell" feel. I am currently working on integrating these patterns into a single gamecontroller so that we can use them in the same level for a boss encounter- Josh
